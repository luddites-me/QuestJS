Some games have limits on how much can be held, so we might only be able to pick up eight items, or whatever.|It is always worthwhile examining an object as it might give you a clue about what it is for. You can examine the hat by typing EXAMINE HAT, LOOK AT HAT or just X HAT. Or click on it in the panel, and select \"Examine\" from the menu.|Most commands in a text adventure will be of the form &lt;verb&gt; &lt;verb&gt;.|Hats can be worn, so let's put it on!

The description for this room mentioned the grass, what happens if you examine that?"},

Can you smell the grass?"},

Hopefully by now you will have guessed you need to say OPEN BOX. On the off-chance that there is a crowbar in there, pick it up (was that a spoiler?)."},

Can you guess how?|The clue was in the question: PUT THE HAT IN THE BOX.|You will need to REMOVE the hat first. And once the hat is in there, close the box.

So we have a crowbar, we can get into the shed.|Up to now we have been using commands that pretty much every game will understand, but games will usually have their own set of commands unique to them, as required by the plot. This game is no different.|One of the problems when playing - and when authoring - a text adventure is deciding how a command should be phrased (a problem known as \"guess the verb\"). Are we going to CROWBAR THE SHED or LEVER OPEN THE DOOR or what? Often it takes some experimenting, though sometimes the text will give you a hint - always worth trying any verb that is used in the text (at least you can be sure the author knows that word).|Often the generic USE will work, so is worth a try."},
  { name:'getTorch', hint:'GET TORCH.', tutorial:"This room has a torch, but it is described in the room description as part of the scenery, so not as obvious as the hat. But you can still pick it up just the same.

And it turns out there is a light switch, but we needed the torch to see the switch.|It is quite common for torch batteries to run out after so many turns, and then you have to re-charge it or find a battery. Hopefully that will not happen here, but it would be a good idea to save the battery just in case, so turn the light on, and turn off the torch."},
  { name:'getAll', hint:'Try GET ALL to pick up everything.', tutorial:"So we have managed to turn on a light!|A lot of adventure games are like this in that you need to do A, but to do that you need to do B, but you cannot do B without doing C first, and so on. And often - as here - you do not know what A even is.|There are a few things down here that we might want to grab. Most adventure games understand the word ALL, so we can just do GET ALL to pick up the lot."},
  { name:'moveCrates', hint:'You cannot take the crates, but you might be able to MOVE CRATES.', tutorial:"Great, you used ALL!|Note that ALL will not include items that are scenery, so not the cobwebs (which are actual objects now, honest - try TAKE COBWEBS), and there are some objected we could not pick up.|You also DROP ALL, WEAR ALL, etc. though some commands will not like it. You could also try DROP ALL BUT QuestJs._templates.ROPE.|You might also want to try eating the apple or reading the newspaper.|When you are done, on with the plot! We cannot take the crates with us, but trying to do so was useful because the response gave us a clue as to what we can do - we can move them."},

It is a good idea to save occasionally whilst playing, just in case you die (not possible in this game) or lose the connection to the server (not an issue for Quest 6) or your PC crashes or you just have some else to do and want to return later. You really do not want to have to start from the beginning, so save your game.|Different systems have different ways to handle saving and loading (and some games may not support it at all), but a good start is to type SAVE."},

As this is a tutorial, you are perfectly safe, though you will get messages saying death is getting more imminent each turn (and will be negative once the time limit expires).|Hey, maybe we'll get some superpower from all that zeta-exposure! No, but seriously kids, zeta-particles are very dangerous, and to be avoided.|In Quest 6, a turn will not pass if you try a command that is not recognised or for meta-commands like HINT; that may not be the case in every game system.|It is a good idea to save before doing a timed challenge, by the way (we saved recently, so no need for us to save now).|Now, get that control rod!"},

  { name:'rGetRod', hint:'Tell the robot to get the rod (ROBOT,GET ROD).', tutorial:"Great, now we can tell the robot to get the rod. By the way, Quest 6 is pretty good at guessing nouns, and often you only need to type a few letters, or even just one letter if there is nothing else here it might be confused with. Try R,GET R.
